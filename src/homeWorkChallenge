• What is the reserved keyword const purpose in Java?
• Can it be used?

 The const keyword in Java is a reserved keyword, but it is not used.
 It was intended to define constant variables (variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned)
 similar to final, but it was never implemented in the language.

 Instead, the final keyword is used for this purpose in Java.

• What is “Cyclic inheritance”?
• Is it allowed in Java?
• Write one (ignore any errors).

Cyclic inheritance occurs when two or more classes are involved in a circular dependency,
meaning Class A depends on Class B, and Class B, in turn, depends on Class A.
This creates a cycle, which can lead to logical and runtime errors.

If you try to create cyclic inheritance in Java, the compiler will generate an error.
